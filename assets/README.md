# Assets Directory

This directory contains the app's static assets including images, icons, and other media files.

## Required Files

For the app to run properly, you'll need to add the following files:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon

## Placeholder Assets

Currently, the app uses emoji and text placeholders for images. In a production environment, you would replace these with actual image assets.

## Image Guidelines

- **App Icon**: 1024x1024px PNG format
- **Splash Screen**: 1242x2436px PNG format (iPhone X dimensions)
- **Adaptive Icon**: 1024x1024px PNG format with safe area
- **Favicon**: 32x32px PNG format

## Usage

The assets are referenced in the `app.json` configuration file and will be automatically bundled with the app during the build process.
